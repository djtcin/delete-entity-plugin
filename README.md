# Xrm entity manipulator
Xrmtoolbox plugin that manipulates an entity and resolves its dependencies. 

This is a work in progress project and this is the list of all planned functionalities:
- Delete entity (list all dependencies and resolve them automatically)
- Rename entity (user gets a chance to chose the new dependencies names, like 1:N and N:N relation names)
- Delete attribute (list all dependencies and resolve them automatically)
- Rename attribute (user gets a chance to chose the new dependencies names)
